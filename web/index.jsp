  <h1>ABOUT Snake</h1>
  Snake is a game where the player maneuvers a line which grows in length, with the line itself being a primary obstacle.
  There is no standard version of the game. The concept originated in the 1976 arcade game Blockade, and its simplicity has
  led to many implementations (some of which have the word snake or worm in the title).
